# Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model built using Python's Scikit-learn library. It covers data generation, model training, prediction, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Linear Regression.ipynb` - The main notebook containing code and explanations.

## 📚 What You Will Learn
- How to generate synthetic data for regression tasks
- How to train a Linear Regression model
- How to evaluate model performance (Mean Squared Error)
- How to visualize results using Matplotlib

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/i3lmd/Linear-Regression.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
3. Open `Linear Regression.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

## 📈 Sample Output
